Take Charles Wiley, who opened a small print shop in lower Manhattan in 1807--the same year the U.S. Congress, provoked by a British warship that opened fire off the coast of Norfolk, Va., passed an embargo preventing American ships from landing at foreign ports unless authorized by President Thomas Jefferson himself.The economic warfare triggered a painful, seven-year recession, but Wiley soldiered on, partnering with Cornelius Van Winkle, a more established Manhattan printer. The two hosted a meeting place for famous scribes like James Fenimore Cooper and William Cullen Bryant and published future legends Edgar Allen Poe and Washington Irving. The company eventually expanded into textbooks and other higher-margin titles. Headquartered in Hoboken, N.J., John Wiley \& Sons now boasts a \$2 billion market capitalization on the New York Stock Exchange.
